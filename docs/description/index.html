    <p>Radiophonic Places is a soundscape project by Jelko Arnds and David Unland that assimilates the sounds of a city to disseminate them via a network of infrastructures in real-time back to the city.</p>
    <p>Multiple channels of audio are recorded from several locations and transmitted through a network of wired and wireless connections, protocols and apparatuses, resulting in a constant stream of data, which is eventually broadcasted via FM Radio.</p>
    <p>The resulting piece puts the listener into the middle of action, both offering an aesthetic access to the mechanisms of a living city and suggesting an idea of superiority through surveillance. It invites for an engagement engages with the audible elements of the urban space, that often times are prominently ignored, and thus creates a map.</p>
    <p>The first conduction of a live-transmission took place in the scope of an exhibition in May 2019 – a room full of Radio Receivers with a giant city map on the floor let the listeners sink into the Radiophonic Places of Bremen.</p>
    <p>Recordings of the Bremian morning hours of May 13th, 2019 can be experienced here:<br/><br/> <a href="../bremen-2019">recording Bremen, May 13th 2019</a></p>
