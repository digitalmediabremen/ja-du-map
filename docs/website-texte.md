## Teaser  

~~We live in a city. Interconnected. Visibly and invisibly. A net of a hidden infrastructure emerges.
All action produces sound. Audio material is assimilated throughout the city and a sonic map is being broadcasted back into it.~~

## Intro  

is a sound sculpture consisting of audio livestreams from several locations in a city. Transmitted through a network of wired and wireless infrastructures, protocols and apparatuses, and mixed algorithmically, the city sounds eventually reach your ears.  
Originally, the gathered sounds were transmitted as collected in real-time and broadcasted via FM Radio (92,5 FM) and additionally provided on radioangrezi.de. On this website we present recordings from Bremen in May 2019.  
Radiophonic Places is a production by Jelko Arnds and David Unland.  
Click onto the city map to navigate through the sound scape. The use of headphones is recommended!

## Info  

Radiophonic Places is a soundscape project by Jelko Arnds and David Unland that assimilates the sounds of the urban space to disseminate them via a network of infrastructures in real-time back to the city.  
Multiple channels of audio are recorded from several locations and transmitted through wired and wireless connections, protocols and apparatuses, resulting in a constant stream of sonic data, which is eventually broadcasted via FM Radio.  
The resulting piece puts the listener into the middle of action, both offering an aesthetic access to the mechanisms of a living city and suggesting an idea of superiority through surveillance. It engages with the audible elements of the urban space, that often times are studiously ignored, to create a sonic image of what’s happening in the city.  
The first conduction of a live-transmission took place in the scope of an exhibition in May 2019 – a room full of Radio Receivers with a giant city map on the floor let the listeners sink into the Radiophonic Places of Bremen.  
Recordings of the Bremian morning hours of May 13th, 2019 can be experienced here: >>listen
