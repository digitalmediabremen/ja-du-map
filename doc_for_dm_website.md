# Radiophonic Places

Radiophonic Places is a hyper-connected, radio-broadcasted, real-time sound project by Jelko Arnds and David Unland.

Multiple channels of audio are assimilated from several locations and sent back to the city instantly. Transmitted through a network of wired and wireless infrastructures, protocols and apparatuses, and mixed algorithmically, the city sounds are eventually broadcasted via FM Radio.

The resulting piece puts the listener into the middle of action, both offering an aesthetic access to the mechanisms of a living city and suggesting an idea of superiority through surveillance. It engages with the audible elements of the urban space, that often times are studiously ignored, to create a sonic image of what’s happening in the city.

The first conduction of a live-transmission took place in the scope of an exhibition in May 2019 – a room full of Radio Receivers with a giant city map on the floor let the listeners sink into the Radiophonic Places of Bremen.
